# Plagiarism Detection Tool

## Overview
The **Plagiarism Detection Tool** is a software application designed to identify instances of plagiarism in written content. It compares submitted documents against a wide range of online and offline sources to detect similarities, including paraphrased or reworded content. The tool is built to promote academic honesty, integrity, and better writing practices by highlighting copied material and encouraging proper citation.

## Features
- **Text Matching:** Identifies exact matches of words or phrases.
- **Paraphrasing Detection:** Uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect reworded content.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** The tool learns over time to detect subtle forms of plagiarism.
- **Database Integration:** Compares documents against a large collection of academic papers, books, and online articles.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy interaction and navigation.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for backend logic and algorithms.
- **Flask/Django**: Framework for creating the web interface (if applicable).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for analyzing sentence structure and meaning.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements algorithms for detecting more subtle plagiarism.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For scraping online sources to build a database of references.
- **SQL/SQLite**: Database for storing user data and plagiarism reports.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: Front-end technologies used to design the user interface.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing the codebase.

## Languages used
1.React.js

2.Typescrpt

3.Tailwind.css

4.Html

5.Css

6.Node.js

7.Javascript

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Additionally, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plagiarism-detection-tool.git
cd plagiarism-detection-tool
```

### Set Up the Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup
For local database storage, you'll need to set up an SQLite database:

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

## Deployment

### Running Locally
To run the tool locally, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the local development server, and you can access the tool in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Deploying to a Web Server
If you wish to deploy the tool on a web server, you can use platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud**. Below are the general steps to deploy the app on **Heroku**:

1. **Install Heroku CLI**: If you havenâ€™t already, install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) from [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. **Login to Heroku**:

    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

3. **Create a Heroku App**:

    ```bash
    heroku create plagiarism-detection-tool
    ```

4. **Deploy to Heroku**:
    Push the local repository to Heroku:

    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

5. **Access the Tool**:
    Once deployed, you can visit your plagiarism detection tool at the URL provided by Heroku (e.g., `https://plagiarism-detection-tool.herokuapp.com/`).

## Usage

1. **Upload a Document**: After logging into the platform, click the "Upload Document" button to submit your text file or paste your content.
2. **Run Plagiarism Check**: The tool will analyze the document and compare it with a large database of existing content.
3. **View Report**: Once the analysis is complete, a detailed report will be generated highlighting plagiarized sections and their sources.
4. **Fix Issues**: Review the report, fix any plagiarism issues, and re-upload your document if needed.
